# PrestaShop Advanced Search

## The plugin extends the search box functionality.
Product suggestions will appear with attractive product information and images instead of the simple name list.

Options:

- **Enable [YES/NO]** - enable / disable plugin in the store.
- **Search type [OR/AND]** - the way the search engine treats multiple words in a field. Selecting OR will cause the search engine to find all products containing any word from all those entered in the field, setting AND will only search for products that contain all of the words.
- **Search within main categories [YES/NO]** - enabling this function will display a list of main categories next to the search field and will allow you to search only within a specific category.
- **CSS** - the ability to add your own CSS styles for the search engine
- **Show results again [YES/NO]** - enabling this function fixes the default search engine behavior in the store - after searching for terms and re-clicking on the field, the search results will not appear until the next character is typed. Enabling this feature fixes the error.
